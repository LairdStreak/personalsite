#In The Beginning.

The most interesting thing about the town where you all live is the small
castle carved into the base of a mountain nearby. It has columns and tiny
windows and everything—and you are pretty sure it’s haunted. Nobody
lives there—nobody has even gone in there in centuries. And yet, at night,
sometimes strange lights flash in the windows, sometimes there’s smoke,
and sometimes you hear strange sounds: the hiss-crack of a giant fire, the
whistling of a strong wind, and a thunderous boom that shakes the ground,
and makes the leaves fall off the all the trees outside.


Or at least, that’s what you’re told. You’ve never been there. It’s haunted, after
all. But that’s all about to change. You have all been dared to spend one full
night in the haunted castle.


That night, you make your way to the castle in the mountain with your
sleeping bags and snacks. From the outside, everything is quiet and still.
Inside, it’s dark, but the moment you enter, braziers filled with fire spring to
life with a whoosh, revealing a large stone room with a wooden table in the
center. A table that’s laden down with what appear to be presents: a shining
silver sword with the word “Jorick” inscribed on the hilt; a huge axe with the
name “Raen” carved on its haft; a pair of fat gold daggers wrapped in paper,
with “Evindol” written down the blades in a fine flowing script; a silvery
wand with the name “Bet” picked out in tiny crystals; and an emerald staff
whose head is carved in the shape of a roaring dragon, to which a tiny note is
attached that reads: “To Yarrow.”
